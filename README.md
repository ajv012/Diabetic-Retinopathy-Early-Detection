# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Early-Detection
I recently started working on creating machine learning algorithms to detect diabetic retinopathy from fundus images. I will keep up;loading files for this project in this repository.

1. Data_Loader.py: This file uses PyTorch and Pandas to load images into Python. Since there are ~10 GB of images, we do not want to load all of them, but just know their ids. This was we can create a memory efficient system. I originally did this using OOP principles, but PyTorch has inherent modules that expedite this process. Hence, I moved on to using pandas and PyTorch.
